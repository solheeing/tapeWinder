## 📍 Introduction

### Project Introduction
**tapeWinder** is a project focused on the design, fabrication, and testing of composite structures using prepreg tape winding.
I started by sketching the initial structure and designed custom molds for winding. These molds were 3D printed using water-soluble Aquaprint filament.
After winding the prepreg tape onto the molds, I evaluated the prototypes and iterated the design to improve structural performance.
The final models were analyzed through CAE simulations and validated with real-world bending tests.
